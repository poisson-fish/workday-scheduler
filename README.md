# Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple client side application that helps you schedule your work day. Hours are color coded based on the current time:

- If gray, the time is in the past.
- If red, it is the current hour.
- If green, it is in the future.

Pressing the save button will save your agenda to local storage, so that you can revisit the page and recheck your schedule.
